# Neo4j Cypher Plan Explorer

This is meant to help people understand the planning of queries in Neo4j.

Unfortunately, you need to have [Jexer](https://github.com/klamonte/jexer) installed in your local Maven repo to be able to build plan_explorer. 
It's not pushed to Maven Central, so you need to build and install yourself.

This is all spare time and best effort work. Don't trust it.
